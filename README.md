# Anjali Contract
This contract features functions of minting and burning of tokens and connecting the local hardhat to remix.

## Getting Started
### VS CODE
1. Setup a hardhat project and then write a contract (Anjali Contract).
2. Deploy the script accordingly.
3. Run the hardhat node by "npx hardhat node" in one terminal.
4. After that deploy the contract on anotherÂ terminal by ./scripts/deploy.js --network localhost".

### REMIX
1. Copy your contract code and paste it on remix (remix.ethereum.org).
2. Change your hardhat environment to dev - hardhat.
3. Copy your contract address from the vs code terminal and paste in it the "at address" input field.
4. Call your contract functions after that and they will be reflected into your vs code terminal where you ran the hardhat node.

## Compiling
